**Learning problem:** International students are a speical group here in the United States. Famous for its top universities especially the Ivy league, the United States attracts tens of thousands of international students into the classsroom. Here at TC, more than 30% of the students come outside US. However, some research have found that a majority of international students are only limited to a small friend circle, rarely hang out with local students or other international student besides those from their country. After the short two or four years of studying abroad, some student regret not broadening their social interaction circle. Survey shows that it is not because they do not want to, but they do not know how to start a conversation. Within a classroom, although students are familiar with the faces, they are hesitant to greet others, let alone asking about personal stuff or very professional topics.


**Content & Interaction:** My website functions with classroom as a unit. Apart from listening to lectures together, classmates using this website should interact with each other academically and also casually. Everyone can post  whatever they want to share, such as their fun facts or country background or feelings about the class, however, anonymously. Classmates are required to guess who they are and people whose guesses are right get a point. On the competition board will show everyone's points. Besides, they can also organize extra-academic activities as well as academic acivity groups such as study group.


**Data:** Firstly, the website asks for classroom information in order to make groups. Sharing anonymously greatly breaks the boundaries of country and culture. People are encouraged to share their feelings and thought online. Therefore, besides basic personal information, people's posting content is also asked for, as well as the tags (acadmic or non-academic). These information will be posted on the board. By these information, students in the classroom should find traces of speaking habits, living background or content a certain interested in. In this way, instead of merely sitting together for classes, classmates interact with others as friends, encouraged to find more commonality and interesting topic to develop friendships. What's more, international students have the opportunity to talk more with others and hang out to same activities.
