**Learning problem:** International students are a speical group here in the United States. Famous for its top universities especially the Ivy league, the United States attracts tens of thousands of international students into the classsroom. Here at TC, more than 30% of the students come outside US. However, some research have found that a majority of international students are only limited to a small friend circle, rarely hang out with local students or other international student besides those from their country. After the short two or four years of studying abroad, some student regret not broadening their social interaction circle. Survey shows that it is not because they do not want to, but they do not know how to start a conversation. They are hesitant to greet others, let alone asking about personal stuff or very professional topics.
